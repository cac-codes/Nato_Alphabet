The NATO alphabet(est. 1956)

The universal phonetic alphabet is used for all military, civilian and amateur radio communications.

It assigns a word to each letter so that a letter's name begins with the letter itself.
Some well known examples include:
Bravo Zulu for "well done"

Checkpoint Charlie (Checkpoint C) in Berlin

Zulu Time for Greenwich Mean Time or Coordinated Universal Time.

During the Vietnam War, the U.S. government referred to the Viet Cong as VC, or Victor Charlie; the name "Charlie" became synonymous with this force.
